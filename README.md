# API-party

This is a small project that allows me practice working with DJANGO REST API.
I will be creating a simple app to organize a series of parties/meetings in the following weeks.
The app allows me gather all the data (different events, and lists of people invited, attending) as well as other vaious information.

All this data will be shared as a public API (that most probably will only be consumed by me :) ).
Hopefully I will learn a bunch of stuff on the way and get a grip on th whole rest api thing.

Anyone having any note or suggestion on this, please feel free to reach out to me, I will be glad to hear from you.
